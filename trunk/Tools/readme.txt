To create your skeleton animations, use the skl_creator.

Load in the template.skl to get started with your animation; and then add as many frames as you need to get a clean smooth animation.

When you are finished, saved the animation to a new .skl file.

You can then use skl2gsa to group a set of animations together to create a gsa (General Skeleton Animation) file that can be used the skeleton code.

(See warrior.gsa in the worldtester\gsa to see what i'm talking about)

Have fun!
